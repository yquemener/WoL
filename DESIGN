This is a Work of Love

Making things I enjoy, curled into my little universe of code.
Starting processes, sharing code with friends, fine-tuning my machines and the little universe we design together.


I copied edoga/ here, because I experimented with some stuff in C++ for this. Not much actually...

I'll do everything in python. Much easier. And leverage other people's work. Bricks so far:

- Ghost (Or just directly PyQt) to draw interfaces and web rendering in textures
- ~~Panda3D to display the textures~~ ~~ModernGL seems better~~ Fuck it, let's go raw
- Python's multiprocessing module to handle execution of different codes
- exec() everywhere!

To check:
- flask as a web server
- something to seccomp untrusted process?
- Will probably need something for fast serving of 'players' positions


2019-03-09 Update: OK, Panda3D is not that easy to tune for my needs. I realized that
Qt is central to what I need: good UI, international inputs. And for that, Qt needs to
be the host of the main window, in order to receive raw events.

I guess I'll have to make my own renderer for now until I find a good 3d engine that do
not ask to be the creator of the context.


pyqt_raw_gl is what works the best right now
