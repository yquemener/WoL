Architecture
============
- Put the collision logic in a saner place
- Clean up the order of the updates
- Debug transparency order
- Make position/orientation properties to help serialization
- Switch to new pos/orient values after the scene update (why, again? (because I think there is a
    sone frame delay in some updates in child-parents mess))
- Make constructors parameter-less and have an init() call, to help serialization
- Reorganize the module hierarchy into something cleaner
- Put the loading code somewhere else than in the main
- Think about key-click actions
- Normaliser les noms d'attributs dans les shaders!
- Does it make sense to create a collider hierarchy?
- Should paint really use the self.program argument?
- Choose if Behaviors or SceneNode should manage on_click and how to transmit to parent


Graphics Enhancements
=====================
- Add meshes
- Widget borders
- Fullscreen mode
- shader for directional light
- shader with ambient
- better mesh structure with faces, normals, option for doing wireframe, etc...

UI
==
- Find a better code highliter
- Show text file names
- UI logic
- Debug console scrolling (allow clicks and check why the scrollbar renders weirdly)
- Add smart indentation to the code view
- More visible pointer
- Add rlcompleter to TextEdit
- Transmit clicks and drag to Qt
- Put cursor on the location we clicked
- Find a good scrolling implementation for too long pages when snapped in view
- Altitude guides? (dashed line a la starcraft for flying units) or shadows

Debug
=====
- Handle the case where a TextLabel is empty
- Compute the correct collision point in Sphere-Ray collisions
- Can't move again after `ESC` on text

Features
========
- Object Explorer (to replace InstanciatedObject)? (wip)
- Parameters editor, to call member functions in the Object Explorer

Done
====
- Have a shader for basic lighting object
- Have a shader for colored object
- Make code widgets adapt to the file size
- Put shaders in separate file that can be sanely highlighted
- Slerp interpolation
X Nettoyer Context d'ailleurs (Why? C'est pas trop mal...)
- Improve the switch between navigation and interaction
- context.scene.sphere -> c'est pas propre
- Don't have the cursor intersect with itself, that's stupids
- Behaviors with local scope
- Add cubes!
- Ability do de-tilt objects by 90° increments (kinda: snaps to closest 90° On Key_1)
- Prevent the grid from being grabbed
- slightly different Z for planes that can z-fight
- Add collisions to cubes
- Anti-aliasing?
