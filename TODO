Architecture
============
- Put the collision logic in a saner place
- Clean up the order of the updates
- Debug transparency order
- context.scene.sphere -> c'est pas propre
- Nettoyer Context d'ailleurs
- Make position/orientation properties to help serialization
- Switch to new pos/orient values after the scene update (why, again?)
- Make constructors parameter-less and have an init() call, to help serialization
- Reorganize the module hierarchy into something cleaner
- Put the loading code somewhere else than in the main
- Think about key-click actions
- Behaviors with local scope

Graphics Enhancements
=====================
- Add cubes!
- Add meshes
- Widget borders
- Fullscreen mode
- shader for directional light
- shader with ambient

UI
==
- Find a better code highliter
- Show text file names
- UI logic
- Debug console scrolling (allow clicks and check why the scrollbar renders weirdly)
- Add smart indentation to the code view
- More visible pointer
- Add rlcompleter to TextEdit
- Improve the switch between navigation and interaction
- Ability do de-tilt objects by 90Â° increments
- Transmit clicks and drag to Qt

Debug
=====
- Handle the case where a TextLabel is empty
- Compute the correct collision point in Sphere-Ray collisions
- Don't have the cursor intersect with itself, that's stupids



Done
====
- Have a shader for basic lighting object
- Have a shader for colored object
- Make code widgets adapt to the file size
- Put shaders in separate file that can be sanely highlighted
- Slerp interpolation
