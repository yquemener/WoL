Architecture
============
- Put the collision logic in a saner place
- Clean up the order of the updates
- Debug transparency order
- context.scene.sphere -> c'est pas propre
- Nettoyer Context d'ailleurs
- Make position/orientation properties and swtich to new values after the scene update (why, again?)
- Make constructors paramter-less and have an init() call, to help serialization
- Reorganize the module hierarchy into something cleaner
- Put the loading code somewhere else than in the main
- Think about key-click actions

Graphics Enhancements
=====================
- Have a shader for colored object
- Have a shader for basic lighting object
- Add cubes!
- Add meshes
- Widget borders

UI
==
- Find a better code highliter
- Show text file names
- UI logic
- Debug console scrolling (allow clicks and check why the scrollbar renders weirdly)
- Add smart indentation to the code view
- More visible pointer
- Add rlcompleter to TextEdit
- Improve the switch between navigation and interaction

Debug
=====
- Handle the case where a TextLabel is empty
- Compute the correct collision point in Sphere-Ray collisions
